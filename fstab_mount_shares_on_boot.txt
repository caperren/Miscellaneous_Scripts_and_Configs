# This goes in /etc/fstab for mounting samba shares on boot
# You need to install cifs-utils (at least on debian based os's) for this to work
# Depending on the OS, sometimes it's necessary to use the second verison, which includes a security flag

# Version One
//server/remote/path /local/path cifs username=[replace],password=[replace],uid=nobody,iocharset=utf8,noperm 0 0

# Version Two
//server/remote/path /local/path cifs username=[replace],password=[replace],uid=nobody,iocharset=utf8,sec=ntlm,noperm 0 0
