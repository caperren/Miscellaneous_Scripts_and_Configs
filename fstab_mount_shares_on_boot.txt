# This goes in /etc/fstab for mounting samba shares on boot
# You need to install cifs-utils (at least on debian based os's) for this to work
# Depending on the OS, sometimes it's necessary to use the second verison, which includes security

# Version One
//server/remote/path /local/path cifs username=[replace],password=[replace],uid=[userid],gid=[groupid],iocharset=utf8 0 0

# Version Two
//server/remote/path /local/path cifs username=[replace],password=[replace],uid=[userid],gid=[groupid],iocharset=utf8,sec=ntlm 0 0
